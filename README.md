# Loan Price Prediction with MLflow

This project utilizes MLflow to develop and deploy a machine learning model for predicting loan prices. MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. In this project, we leverage MLflow to track experiments, package code, and manage model deployment.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains historical data on loans, including various attributes such as loan amount, interest rate, credit score, income, employment status, and other relevant features. The target variable is the price of the loan.
